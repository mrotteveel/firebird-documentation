`<{nbsp}0`:: low priority (sets `IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS`)
`0`:: normal priority (sets `NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`)

equivalent to using the `-b[oostpriority]` commandline option of `instsvc.exe`

Configures the process priority on Windows, which is used by the CPU scheduler to decide how and when to schedule threads of the Firebird process(es).

Setting a negative value may reduce responsiveness of the Firebird server if the system is otherwise busy, and setting a positive value may result in Firebird starving other process of CPU cycles.
In general, do not set this to anything other than `0`, and if you do set it, carefully test if your system responds correctly.
