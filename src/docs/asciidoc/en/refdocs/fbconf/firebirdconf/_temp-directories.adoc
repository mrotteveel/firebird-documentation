[#fbconf-temp-directories]
= `TempDirectories`

Directories used by the Firebird engine for temporary files.

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
TempDirectories = <path-list>

<path-list> ::= _path_ [; _path_ ...]
----

.Default
Value of environment variable `FIREBIRD_TMP`, `TEMP`, _or_ `TMP`.

The `<path-list>` is a semicolon-separated list of directories.
It is possible to use absolute paths (e.g. Windows -- `C:\Database`, Linux -- `/db`), and relative paths.
Relative paths are resolved against the root directory of Firebird.
Given relative paths are not always obvious, it is recommended to use absolute paths.

Firebird will use the first directory listed until it runs out of disk space, then switch to the next directory in the list, and so on.

.Examples
----
# Multiple directories (Windows)
TempDirectories = C:\Temp\Firebird;D:\Temp\Firebird
# Single directory (Linux)
TempDirectores = /tmp/firebird
