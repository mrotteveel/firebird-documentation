[NOTE]
====
This setting only has effect on Windows 8 and higher and Windows Server 2012 and higher.
Microsoft now discourages its use and advises not to use it as it can cause problems with kernel-level filter drivers on socket connections.

In response, Firebird has deprecated this setting in Firebird 3.0.11 and 4.0.3 -- changing its default to `0` (disabled), and removed it in Firebird 5.0.
====

The "`TCP Loopback Fast Path`" can improve performance of localhost connections on Windows systems.
For it to work, both the client and server need to enable the `SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH` on the socket before connecting.

As this option is now deprecated, and Microsoft advises not to use it, exercise caution with this option, and leave or set it disabled.
