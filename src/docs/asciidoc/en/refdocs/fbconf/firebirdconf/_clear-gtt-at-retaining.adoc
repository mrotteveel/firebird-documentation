= `ClearGTTAtRetaining`

Configures if Global Temporary Tables (GTT) with `ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS` are cleared on commit/rollback retaining.

ClearGTTAtRetaining = _Boolean_

.Default
`0` (false)

This is a compatibility setting to restore behaviour of Global Temporary Tables as it was in Firebird 2.1.
In the normal behaviour (`ClearGTTAtRetaining = 0`), a Global Temporary Table with `ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS` is cleared at a hard commit or rollback, but is retained and the data is accessible after a commit retain or rollback retain.
When enabled (`ClearGTTAtRetaining = 1`), the table is also cleared on commit retain or rollback retain.

----
# Enable clearing GTT at commit/rollback retain
ClearGTTAtRetaining = 1
