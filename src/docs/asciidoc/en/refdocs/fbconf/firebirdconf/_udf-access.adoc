= `UdfAccess`

Configures paths allowed for loading UDF -- User-Defined Function -- libraries.

.Configuration

[horizontal.compact]
Deprecated:: 4.0

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
UdfAccess = <udf-access-config>

<udf-access-config> ::=
    None
  | Full
  | Restrict <path-list>

<path-list> ::= _path_ [; _path_ ...]
----

.Default
`None`

.Supported values
`None`::
UDF libraries are not loaded.

`Full`::
All paths are allowed for UDF libraries

`Restrict <path-list>`::
Files with a path rooted in the directories listed in `<path-list>` (that is, the file is in a listed directory or in a subdirectory of a listed directory) are allowed for UDF libraries.
+
The `<path-list>` is a semicolon-separated list of directories.
It is possible to use absolute paths (e.g. Windows -- `C:\ExternalFiles`, Linux -- `/externalfiles`), and relative paths.
Relative paths are resolved against the root directory of Firebird.
Given relative paths are not always obvious, it is recommended to use absolute paths.

UDFs and by extension `UdfAccess` is deprecated.
The recommended replacements are built-in functions, PSQL functions (introduced in Firebird 3.0), or UDR functions (User-Defined Routine, introduced in Firebird 3.0).

.Security recommendation
[CAUTION]
====
UDFs are inherently insecure and can compromise the security of your system and database.
If possible, do not use UDFs and keep `UdfAccess` set to `None`, and if you do need UDFs, do not use `Full`, but explicitly list the allowed directories using `Restrict`.

We also recommend that there is no overlap with the directories listed in <<fbconf-external-file-access>>.
That is, directories listed in `UdfAccess` should not be the same as, be contained in, or contain the directories listed in `ExternalFileAccess`.
See <<fbconf-external-file-access>> for more information.
