[#fbconf-ipv6-v6-only]
= `IPv6V6Only`

When enabled, sets the `IPV6_V6ONLY` socket option on the listener socket.

.Configuration

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
IPv6V6Only = _Boolean_
----

.Default
`0` (disabled)

By default, the Firebird server listens on the zero IPv6 address (`::`) and accepts all incoming connections, whether IPv4 or IPv6, and `IPv6V6Only` is set to false (`0`).
If it is set to true (`1`), the server, still listening implicitly or explicitly on the zero IPv6 address, will accept only IPv6 connections.

A different listening address, either IPv4 or IPv6, can be set using the <<fbconf-remote-bind-address>> parameter.
If an IPv4 address or a non-zero IPv6 address is used, the `IPv6V6Only` setting has no effect.

When enabled, this will also reject IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses as a value of `RemoteBindAddress`.
