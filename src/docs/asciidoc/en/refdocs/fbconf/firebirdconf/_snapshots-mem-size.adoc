The memory for snapshots is allocated per database.
Each active snapshot uses 16 bytes of memory.

The value of `SnapshotsMemSize` is the initial size and the allocation unit.
The memory will grow dynamically as needed in increments of this allocation unit, until the system runs out of memory.

Snapshots are used to provide a stable view on data within a transaction or during statement execution.
