[#fbconf-remote-pipe-name]
= `RemotePipeName`

Name of the pipe used as a transport channel in the WNET (a.k.a. NetBEUI) protocol (Windows only).

.Default
`interbas`

Server-side, the configuration is used to create the pipe to accept WNET connections, and for creating WNET connections to other servers.
Client-side, the configuration is used to open the pipe to make WNET connections to the server.

You can configure this value if you have multiple Firebird servers running on the same machine which all need to be able to accept WNET connections.
In that case, clients will need to be configured with that `RemotePipeName` as well, either in their `firebird.conf`, or through `isc_dpb_config`.
