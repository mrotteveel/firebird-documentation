[#fbconf-deadlock-timeout]
= `DeadlockTimeout`

Timeout for detecting and purging locks held by dead processes in case of a lock conflict.

.Configuration
Global, and per-database

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
DeadlockTimeout = _integer_
----

.Unit
Second

.Default
`10`

The deadlock timeout is the number of seconds the lock manager will wait in case of a lock conflict before purging locks of dead processes and doing an extra deadlock scan cycle.
In normal cases, Firebird will detect deadlocks instantly, so this timeout is only to detect exceptional cases.

Setting this setting too low may increase load and reduce performance.
