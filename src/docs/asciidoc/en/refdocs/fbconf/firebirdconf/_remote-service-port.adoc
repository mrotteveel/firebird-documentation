[#fbconf-remote-service-port]
= `RemoteServicePort`

The TCP service port number to be used for database connections.

.Configuration
Global, client-side, and per-connection

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
RemoteServicePort = _integer_
----

.Range
`1` - `65535`

.Default
`3050`

Configures the TCP port to use.

Server-side::
Determines the port that the server listens for connections
Client-side and per-connection::
Determines the port to use if none is specified in the connection URL

The order of precedence is explicitly set values before defaults, and `RemoteServiceName` -- if an entry is found in the `services` file -- before `RemoteServicePort`.
In other words, if `RemoteServiceName` is not explicitly set, and `RemoteServicePort` is explicitly set, the value of `RemoteServicePort` is used.

.Example
[listing]
----
# Use port 3051 instead of 3050
RemoteServicePort = 3051
