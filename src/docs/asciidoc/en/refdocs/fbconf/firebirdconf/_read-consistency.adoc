Since Firebird 4.0, `READ COMMITTED` by default always uses the `READ CONSISTENCY` mode, even if `[NO] RECORD VERSION` (`isc_tpb_rec_version`/`isc_tpb_no_rec_version`) is requested.
If `ReadConsistency` is set to `0` (false), the requested mode is used.

This setting is intended for backwards compatibility, if your application specifically depends on the behaviour of `[NO] RECORD VERSION`.
In general, we recommend to leave it at its default value.
