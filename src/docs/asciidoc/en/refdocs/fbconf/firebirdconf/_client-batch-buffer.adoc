This configuration item governs size of the client-side buffers for statement parameters _and_ blobs for batch execution.
Given blob and parameters are stored in separate buffers, the total space allocated is upto twice the configured size, per `Batch` instance.
Irrespective of the configured buffer size, the client will allocate sufficient space to buffer at least one set of statement parameters.

# Buffer two megabyte
