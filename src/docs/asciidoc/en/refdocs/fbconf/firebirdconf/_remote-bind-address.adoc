[#fbconf-remote-bind-address]
= `RemoteBindAddress`

Network interface of the TCP/IP listener.

.Configuration
Global

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
RemoteBindAddress = _string_
----

.Default
Empty (bind to `::`)

The setting accepts an IPv4 or IPv6 address, which may optionally be enclosed in square brackets.

By default, when not specified, or explicitly empty, Firebird listens on `::` (the zero IPv6 address).
The exact behaviour of the zero IPv6 address depends on <<fbconf-ipv6-v6-only>>:

* if disabled (the default), Firebird listens on all IPv4 and IPv6 network interfaces of the host.
* if enabled, Firebird only listens on all the IPv6 network interfaces of the host (not IPv4).

It is not possible to specify multiple bind addresses.

If <<fbconf-ipv6-v6-only>> is enabled, IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are rejected.

.Examples
[listing]
----
# listen on IPv4 localhost
RemoteBindAddress = 127.0.0.1

# listen on IPv6 localhost
RemoteBindAddress = ::1

# listen on all IPv4 network interfaces of the host
RemoteBindAddress = 0.0.0.0
