[#fbconf-wire-compression]
= `WireCompression`

Enables (zlib) wire compression of connections.

.Configuration
Client-side, and per-connection

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
WireCompression = _Boolean_
----

.Default
`false`

This setting is ignored if the client library does not have access to the zlib library (`zlib1.dll`/`libz.so.1`).

It is not possible to disable wire compression server-side;
if the client requests compression, the server will enable compression.

.Example
[listing]
----
# Enable wire compression
WireCompression = true
