When an external connection is returned to the idle list of the pool, a timer is started.
At or after this timer reaches `ExtConnPoolLifeTime`, the connection will be closed and removed from the pool.

The timer is stopped and cleared when the connection is returned to the active list of the pool.

The external connections pool is a connection pool for the external data source (EDS) subsystem.
