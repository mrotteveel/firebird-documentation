.Range

.Default
`0` (use random port)

When a client listens for events, it establishes a secondary connection to the Firebird server, using a port number the server sends to the client.
By default, a random port is used.

This setting can be used to specify a fixed port number, for example one that can be allowed through the firewall.

.Example
[listing]
----
# Use port 3051 instead of a random port
RemoteAuxPort = 3051
