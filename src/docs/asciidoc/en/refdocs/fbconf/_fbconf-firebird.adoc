[#fbconf-firebird]
= `firebird.conf`

The `firebird.conf` configuration file serves three purposes:

. Configuring the Firebird server process
. Configuring client connections made by the Firebird server
+
For example, for connections made with https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/refdocs/fblangref40/firebird-40-language-reference.html#fblangref40-psql-execstmt-onexternal[`EXECUTE STATEMENT ... ON EXTERNAL`]
. Configuring client connections made by other processes.
+
This is basically the general case of the second item.

The third item does have a big caveat.
The `firebird.conf` in the Firebird installation directory will not configure *all* client connections, only those client connections which

. use `fbclient.dll`/`libfbclient.so`, and
. where the _fbclient_ library actually reads that `firebird.conf` file.

If your application uses its own `fbclient.dll`, it will read and use the client configuration in the `firebird.conf` in the same directory as that DLL, _if it exists_, not the `firebird.conf` in a Firebird installation directory.

The configuration used by a client can also be overridden using the `isc_dpb_config` information item.
Its content are key-value pairs as used in `firebird.conf`, and their values will take precedence over the client configuration in `firebird.conf`.

Some server-side configuration items in `firebird.conf` can also be configured per database in <<fbconf-databases,`databases.conf`>>.
The value in `databases.conf` takes precedence over the value in `firebird.conf`, which takes precedence over the default value.
If a value is user-configurable (e.g. through the database parameter buffer (DPB) or a `SET` statement), that value will generally take precedence for the current connection, though in some cases the server configuration may establish an upper limit (e.g. for timeouts).

// TODO Client-side use of databases.conf?

Since Firebird 4.0, it is possible to query configuration settings of the current database for the current connection from the https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/refdocs/fblangref40/firebird-40-language-reference.html#fblangref-appx04-config[`RDB$CONFIG`] virtual table:

[#fbconf-cfg]
== Configuration items

The following sections list the configuration items supported in `firebird.conf`.
If a configuration item is also valid in `databases.conf`, this is mentioned explicitly.
Unless mentioned otherwise, configuration items are server-side only.

Where applicable, we'll report the version that a configuration item was added, deprecated, or removed;
see also <<fbconf-intro-conventions>>.

// TODO Consider grouping the items by subject
// Initially, we list them in the order of firebird.conf
The configuration items are listed in the order of appearance in the default `firebird.conf` file.
