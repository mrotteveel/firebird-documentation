[#fbconf-databases]
= `databases.conf`

The file `databases.conf` defines aliases for databases, and -- optionally -- database specific configuration.
It can be used both server-side, and client-side.

You can define multiple aliases for a single database, but only one of those aliases can be a <<fbconf-syntax-scope,complex scoped value>> (that is, have configuration between braces).

== Server-side usage

When used server-side, the file defines aliases that the server redirects to a specific database file, and -- if specified -- database-specific configuration used by the server for the database file.

The configuration specified in the complex scoped value applies for all connections to that database, not just connections using that specific alias.

Only _per-database_ configuration items are supported, other configurations items are ignored.

== Client-side usage

When used client-side, the file defines aliases that the client can use as alternative connection strings, and the configuration the client uses for the connection if the connection string matches that alias, or the value of that alias, _exactly_.

The value of the alias can only be a filename, or a legacy connection string.
At this time, modern URL connection strings are not supported.
See also https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8302[firebird#8302].

Only _per-database_ *and* __client-side__ configuration items are supported, other configurations items are ignored.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible some connection properties are only _per-database_ server-side, and global client-side, or vice versa.
If you find such a case, please report it on the https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird-documentation/issues[firebird-documentation repository] so we can update the documentation.
